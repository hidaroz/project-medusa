# Project Medusa

This repo is for **Project Medusa**, an academic research initiative focused on developing an **autonomous AI-driven cybersecurity agent** for educational and authorized penetration testing. The project explores how artificial intelligence can simulate adaptive offensive and defensive behaviors within **controlled, sandboxed environments**.

---

## Purpose

**Project Medusa** is built to support **cybersecurity education and research**. It helps students and researchers study real-world attack and defense dynamics safely by using AI to model adaptive threat behavior.

This project is strictly for **educational use only** and is conducted under proper supervision within **isolated systems**.

---

## Current Focus

- Refining the *Detect → Assess → Adapt* logic loop  
- Adding a *Context-Persistence Layer* to improve learning and consistency  
- Expanding *Multi-Layered Sensing* for network and host-level awareness  
- Conducting sandboxed simulations for validation
