# FEEDBACK

## From Team8:
- The demo presentation felt slightly abstract at this moment
- A brief summary or on-screen indicator showing the current phase (Phase 1–4) would make the workflow much clearer to non-technical audiences.
-  USB: Maybe inserting a USB drive labeled “MEDUSA” during the demo could trigger the CLI run and show how the agent automatically begins reconnaissance on a local test server.
- clarify how Medusa will be packaged and delivered (virtual env)

## From Professor:
- Clearly define who will use Medusa at each level(since hacker industry is different, they don't have the position like HR...)
- Create clear personas and a minimal RBAC matrix so everyone — reviewers and demo runners — understands who can do what.
- Host both Docker and Medusa components on the cloud for easier demo access.
- Think about a cloud-hosted version that reviewers can access with tokens.
- Document deployment steps clearly: docker-compose up, token access, and shutdown/cleanup instructions.
