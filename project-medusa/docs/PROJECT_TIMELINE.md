### Wednesday-Thursday: Stealth Analysis
- [ ] Review EDR logs from all test runs
- [ ] Calculate Stealth Score for each scenario
- [ ] Identify most common alert triggers
- [ ] Document evasion techniques Medusa discovered

### Friday-Weekend: Data Visualization

## **Critical Path Items (Cannot Be Delayed)**
1. **Dataset creation (Week 1)** - Everything depends on this
2. **Fine-tuning completion (Week 2)** - Must work before integration
3. **OODA loop (Week 4)** - Core functionality for demo
4. **Metrics collection (Week 5)** - Needed for paper results

## **Time-Saving Strategies**
- Use Linux VMs only (simpler than Windows AD)
- Limit network to 3 hosts maximum
- Focus on 2-3 attack techniques deeply rather than many superficially
- Use existing Docker images (Kali, Ubuntu) rather than building from scratch
- For paper, use conference template (ACM, IEEE) to save formatting time

## **Contingency Plans**
- **If fine-tuning fails:** Use base Llama 3 with extensive prompt engineering
- **If Docker issues persist:** Run VMs in VirtualBox instead
- **If full autonomy is buggy:** Focus on semi-autonomous mode (human approves each step)
- **If time runs short:** Cut comparison with other tools, focus on proving Medusa works

## **Weekly Check-ins**
Every Sunday evening, assess:
1. What % of this week's tasks are complete?
2. What blockers exist?
3. Do I need to adjust next week's scope?
