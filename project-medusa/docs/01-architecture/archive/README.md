## Archived Files

### CURRENT-STATUS.md.old
- **Date**: 2025-11-14 (future date - likely incorrect)
- **Claimed Status**: 95% complete
- **Issues**: Future date, overly optimistic completion percentage, ChromaDB blocker

### FINAL-STATUS.md.old
- **Date**: 2025-11-12
- **Claimed Status**: 85% complete
- **Issues**: Conflicting with other status files, outdated information

### implementation-status.md.old
- **Date**: 2025-11-12
- **Claimed Status**: 85% complete
- **Issues**: Duplicate of FINAL-STATUS.md with minor differences

### implementation-status-old.md.old
- **Date**: 2025-11-12
- **Claimed Status**: 65% complete
- **Issues**: Most conservative estimate, likely most accurate at time of writing

## Why Consolidated?

**Problems with Multiple Status Files**:
1. **Conflicting Information**: Completion percentages ranged from 65% to 95%
2. **Outdated Data**: Some files had future dates or old information
3. **Confusion**: Unclear which file was authoritative
4. **Maintenance Burden**: Multiple files to update

**Solution**:
- Created single [`IMPLEMENTATION-STATUS.md`](../IMPLEMENTATION-STATUS.md)
- Based on actual codebase verification
- Accurate as of 2025-11-20
- Single source of truth

## What Changed?

**New Status Document Includes**:
- ✅ Verified implementation status based on actual code review
- ✅ Accurate code metrics (100 Python files, ~25,000 lines)
- ✅ Detailed component breakdown with file references
- ✅ Known gaps and next steps
- ✅ Realistic assessment of what's working vs. what needs work

**Key Findings**:
- LangGraph multi-agent system is **complete**
- AWS Bedrock integration is **production-ready**
- 5 specialized agents are **fully implemented**
- Lab environment with 8 services is **operational**
- ChromaDB dependency status needs **clarification**
