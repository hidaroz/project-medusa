# Industry Stakeholders Feedback

## Project Evolution Through Stakeholder Input

Throughout the past three weeks of developing Medusa, feedback from industry stakeholders has been essential in refining our hypothesis. We began with the idea that an AI-driven cybersecurity agent could enhance system defense using an adaptive loop based on the OODA (Observe, Orient, Decide, Act) framework. As the project progressed, we realized that adaptability alone was not enough. Effective validation required better context awareness, data persistence, and transparent decision-making.

## Stakeholder Interviews

To align our work with real-world needs, we conducted interviews with two senior healthcare cybersecurity professionals in China:

### Interview Participants
- **Senior Security Manager** from the Second Affiliated Hospital of Kunming Medical University
- **Information Security Researcher** from the Research Center for Healthcare Data Science in Zhejiang

### Interview Methodology
- **Duration:** 45 minutes each
- **Focus Question:** What technical capabilities would make an AI agent both a credible offensive threat and a valuable defensive tool?

## Key Feedback and Implementation

### 1. Intelligent and Controlled Reaction System
**Source:** Senior Security Manager  
**Requirement:** Create an intelligent and controlled reaction system for handling IDS alerts, honeypots, and account lockouts  
**Implementation:** Developed "Detect → Assess → Adapt" model that made Medusa more strategic and less reactive  
**Impact:** Enhanced strategic decision-making capabilities

### 2. Context Retention and Persistence
**Source:** Information Security Researcher  
**Requirement:** Address gap in context retention for better consistency and accuracy  
**Implementation:** Developed a context-persistence layer with shared state manager  
**Impact:** Improved Medusa's ability to remember previous interactions and maintain consistency

### 3. Multi-Layered Sensing
**Source:** Both experts  
**Requirement:** Analyze signals from both network and host environments  
**Implementation:** Enhanced Medusa's capability to process multi-layered environmental signals  
**Impact:** More comprehensive threat detection and response capabilities

## Conclusion

The stakeholder feedback transformed Medusa from a reactive tool to a strategic, context-aware system that aligns with real-world healthcare cybersecurity needs.
