# PROJECT MEDUSA: AI Adversary Simulation

## ⚠️ Mission Classification
**Offensive Security Research Initiative**  
**For Authorized Testing Purposes Only**

---

## Executive Summary

Project Medusa is an offensive security research initiative designed to engineer and deploy an autonomous, LLM-driven adversary within a high-fidelity kill box environment. This project tests the hypothesis that an agentic language model, functioning as a reasoning engine within a Command & Control (C2) framework, provides a decisive tactical advantage in the post-exploitation phase of network compromise.

## The Two-Sided Architecture

Project Medusa consists of two distinct, complementary components:

### 1️⃣ The Target Environment (`medusa-webapp/`)

**Type:** Mock EHR Web Application  
**Purpose:** Realistic target for adversary simulation  
**Technology:** Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS

#### Characteristics:
- ✅ High-fidelity, professional medical interface
- ✅ No real backend logic or database
- ✅ All data is mocked and static
- ✅ Safe for contained testing environments
- ✅ Presentation-ready UI/UX

#### Features:
- Professional login interface
- Patient dashboard with statistics
- Detailed patient records with medical data
- **Critical allergy alert system**
- Insurance and emergency contact information
- Dark-themed, responsive design

**Status:** ✅ Initial foundation complete

### 2️⃣ The Operator (`medusa-cli/`)

**Type:** Command & Control CLI  
**Purpose:** AI agent deployment and management  
**Technology:** Python

#### Characteristics:
- 🔨 Command-line interface for operators
- 🔨 LLM-powered autonomous agent
- 🔨 Docker-based kill box management
- 🔨 Strategic objective setting
- 🔨 Real-time monitoring and reporting

#### Planned Capabilities:
- Deploy AI agents with strategic goals
- Monitor autonomous decision-making
- Execute post-exploitation techniques
- Generate operation reports
- Emergency stop mechanisms

**Status:** 🔨 Basic structure established, core features pending
